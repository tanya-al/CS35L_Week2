CS 35L Week 3 Lab Log
First, download Coreutils 7.6 by calling wget
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz. Next, run the command tar
-xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz to untar and unzip the coreutils file. We also have
to create a new directory to move the fixed version into later, since SeasNet
won't allow us to make changes to the bin. So, mkdir coreutilsInstall. Now, we
can open the coreutils-7.6 directory that we installed and run the command
./configure --prefix=~/coreutilsInstall. This will take care of the install
section of the makefile so that when we invoke the make and make install
commands, the program will be compiled with the proper dependencies(so we don't
have to compile everything everytime) and its executable will be moved to the
directory we created earlier (coreutilsInstall). Make sure you use the ABSOLUTE
PATH with the prefix option, otherwise it won't work! 
The next step is to run the executable and see the effect it has on the ls
command. To accomplish this, navigate to ~/coreutilsInstall/bin and run the
command ./ls -l. The result will show dates written in the buggy format. 
For the next part, I manually looked at the patch and edited the necessary lines
to implement the patch. Then, I ran the make command again on the coreutils-7.6
folder to recompile everything and deal with all the changes to ls.c. 
Finally, I tested the patch on a new file (emacs new_file) and a year old file
(touch -t 201504100959.30 old_file). Both of these now show the correct date
format.
