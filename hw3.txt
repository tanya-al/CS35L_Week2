Homework 3 Text
Q1. It was necessary to remove that line because the goto statement in the for
loop was exiting the loop before setting the proper locale for the
statement. This left the program in an unresolved state.
Q2. Yes, this version would cause a problem because it will always print the
format in the classic Ubuntu English style, which would probably leave
non-English-speaking users very confused about the state of their locale.
Q3. An index out of bounds error is raised by invoking this python script on
/dev/null because the sequence of lines to choose from is empty and we can't
choose a random line if there are no lines to choose from. 
Q4. Python3 instead of just python results in a syntax error because Python 3
doesn't allow iteration over exception parameters. The reason for not allowing
this is that how it actually works (by iterating over the exception) makes it
unclear what is actually happening in the code, and Python strives to be
extremely explicit in all of its commands.
